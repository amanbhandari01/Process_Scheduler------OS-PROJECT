# Process_Scheduler------OS-PROJECT

The objective of this project is to explore operating system scheduling and
various scheduling algorithms. Operating system scheduling refers to the
process of assigning tasks to be executed by the CPU. This is an important
aspect of operating systems, as it determines the efficiency and
performance of the system.
Through this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of operating
system scheduling and the impact it has on system performance. We will
implement these algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness through
simulations.

## TYPES OF SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Shortest Remaining Time
First(SRTF)
Priority Scheduling
Round Robin Scheduling
